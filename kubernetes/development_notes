for development branch testing

Use k8 auth.yaml, tasks-dev.yaml, and users-dev.yaml 
No PV/PVC (commented out)
ports 8080 and 8082
This comes up fine
/logs will come up if there is a /users directory created and built in to the image.  In this case there is no /users directory built into the image.
(users image2)
This crashes when hitting the /logs directory

Scenario 2
Use k8 auth.yaml, tasks-dev.yaml, and users-prod-port8080-image3.yaml
Image3 with PV and PVC: the container will not come up 

Scenario 3
use k8 auth.yaml, tasks-dev.yaml, and users-dev1-image3.yaml. Image3 with no PV and no PVC yaml configuration
Image 3 without PV and PVC yaml configuration: the container comes up and does not crash when hitting /logs

For development best to use Scenario 3 until I add the local volume.  Without a local volume the /users logs are not persistent and will not survive a reboot of the container.

Try out kustomize to deal with this. There is also the port issue with docker desktop and the ports 8080 and 8082 have to be used instead of port 80s in the production/master k8s.
So kustomize is probably the best solution to the static changes reqired for development vs. production (master)
